DJANGO FRIEND CLASS CODE

The code in this django project is a User model and Friendship model that can be applied in any social-media style site where Friendship relationships are needed.  Included are views that allow the user to add friends, delete friends, show all of the a particular user's friends, and confirm friendships.  The output of these views is JSON, as this code is only for the backend.  Included is an Auth Token authentication scheme, which provides security and allows django to access the User through Auth Tokens when that user makes requests.
